Real-time Modified Beer-Lambert Module

Written by T. Huppert, University of Pittsburgh

This module computes oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin changes
in real-time.  This code uses a online Kalman filter to 
estimate the mean intensity of light for each measurement.  

Note: no differential pathlength factors are currently used.
